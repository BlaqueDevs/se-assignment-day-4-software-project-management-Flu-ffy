Break the project into sprints to continuously review and adjust spending.

 
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile allows for frequent changes, making it suitable for dynamic projects, whereas Waterfall follows a fixed structure, which is best for well-defined projects.
Agile follows an iterative approach with incremental progress, whereas Waterfall has a set timeline with each phase following the previous one.
Agile requires continuous collaboration with stakeholders, whereas Waterfall has minimal stakeholder involvement after initial requirements gathering.
Continuous testing throughout development in Agile, whereas in waterfall testing occurs after development is complete.

Advantages of Agile:
  Flexibility & Adaptability – Agile allows for changes at any stage based on feedback.
  Faster Time-to-Market – Delivering in increments ensures early value realization.
  Improved Collaboration – Continuous stakeholder and team involvement improves 
  alignment.
  Higher Customer Satisfaction – Frequent feedback loops ensure the product meets 
  expectations.
Disadvantages of Agile:
  Less Predictable Budget & Timeline – Changing requirements can cause cost and 
  schedule variations.
  High Dependency on Teamwork – Agile requires active participation from all members, 
  which can be challenging.
  Scope Creep Risk – Without proper control, frequent changes can lead to project 
  delays.
  Requires an Experienced Team – Agile is hard to implement without a skilled team and 
  strong collaboration.

  Advantages of Waterfall:
   Clear Structure & Predictability – Well-defined stages make planning and execution 
  straightforward.
  Easier Budgeting & Scheduling – Fixed scope allows for precise cost and time 
  estimations.
  Comprehensive Documentation – Detailed documentation ensures clarity for 
  stakeholders and future maintenance.
  Best for Stable Requirements – Works well for projects where the scope and 
  requirements are unlikely to change.
Disadvantages of Waterfall:
  Inflexibility to Changes – Once a phase is completed, changes are difficult and 
  expensive.
  Late Testing & Risk Discovery – Issues are often found late in the project, leading 
  to costly fixes.
  Slow Time-to-Market – The final product is delivered at the end, which may take 
  months or years.
  Minimal Customer Feedback During Development – Customers only see the final product, 
  increasing the risk of misalignment with their needs.



## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Use Agile:
Dynamic & evolving projects – Requirements change frequently.
Customer-driven products – Continuous feedback is required.
Fast-paced environments – Speed to market is critical.
Innovative or experimental projects – Uncertainty exists in scope.
Examples of Projects Suitable for Agile:
  Software Startups and Software as Service Products like A food delivery app like 
  Uber Eats.
  A Django-powered online auction system for artists
Reasons:
  Features need to be adjusted based on user feedback, competitors, and market trends.
  E-commerce Platforms & Marketplaces
  User experience, bidding mechanics, and payment integrations may need adjustments 
  after testing.

Use Waterfall:
Well-defined projects – Requirements are clear and unlikely to change.
Regulated industries – Compliance and security are strict.
Large enterprise projects – Complex, structured, and long-term.
Infrastructure-heavy projects – Physical and software dependencies exist.
Examples of Projects Suitable for Waterfall:
  Government or Defense Systems like: A national tax filing system.
  Banking & Financial Systems:  A core banking software upgrade.
  Healthcare & Medical Record Systems: A hospital management system.
Reason:
 Compliance, legal, and regulatory constraints require fixed planning and 
 documentation.
 High-security risks, strict regulations, and zero room for error.
 Strict compliance (HIPAA, GDPR), legal approvals, and long development cycles.




## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
 Establish Quality Objectives – Define performance, security, usability, and compliance benchmarks.
